# Tornado Showcase
It is a showcase of my several small Single-Page-Apps in one bundle app powered by Python Tornado. 

In it you can find 'Tic Tac Toe', 'Simon', 'Mini-Wiki' those built by html/JQuery and 'Timezone Converter' which is built by Python. 

Also you can send messages directly to my mailbox from the app.

## Apps in Bundle
- **Tic-Tac-Toe**: A classical chess game made with JQuery
- **Simon Game**: A retro game to test your responding made with JQuery
- **Mini-Wiki**: A functional but tiny Wikipedia interface
- **Timzone Converter**: A useful tool to switch world-wide timezone for you, made with Python

## Nerd's thinking
### Gains:
- It was my first web app using Python, very excited
- UI were responsible for different devices
- It was amazing to send mails onsite

### Pains:
- I hadn't learnt redirection or other directives for page management when making this app, so the navigation for different pages was clumsy

## Major Techs:
- Python
- Tornado
- JQuery
- Jinja2
